Gemeral To do lists:

1.  Set up and configure the GitHub repositary.
(part of this is the tutorial on Canvas)
# Note this is more complicated than it need to be, by doing it through the command line.

2.  Rockets:
  a.  Fuel.  Seems to be Rb.1 (Kerosene but better) along with Liquid Oxygen.  At least for space X.
  b.  Units of measurement.  Seems to be in Newtons as a form of thrust.  Constant force and mass = constant acceleration 
  Stats.  845 KN for Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy.  In space  981 and 981.  The Draco and Super draco rockets are much less pwoerufl (at most 735 KN)  Starship?

What is FT and is 230 Ft / 507 klbf any good?  vs 258 tf and 568 klbf  but what of 1,500 TF and 3.3 MLBF?  7590 TF vs 16.7 Mlbf?

1 tf = 9.80665 KiloNewtons  So do the math or whatever
