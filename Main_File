Fortunately, there is time dilation so you don't die before you get there ;)

The equation for time dialation is t' =t /Sqrt[1-v^2/c^2].  Where t' is time measured from the perspective of the person traveling the speed of light.
In essence the faster you move, the 'shorter' the world becomes.  
So if we apply our time dilation math to our base value of 0.000212716 hours, and apply our time dilation math we get 4.5248*10^-8  hours

It can be hard to grasp how much this changes things.  Let's look at a distance like Alpha Centauri.  Located around 4.2 Light Years away that's 3.9735*10^16 meters, 
a pretty far distance!
Using our old math it would take us 5.06464 hours to travel there.  But with relativisitc motion we see that it takes 0.00107733 hours instead!
Of course all of this
is relative to the us on the rocket ship.  To our friend Jared however it would still look like it would only take 5.06464 hours to get to Alpha Centauri
